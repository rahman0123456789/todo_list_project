# todo_list_project
todo list project in typescript.

ðŸš€I've created a TypeScript-based console application that empowers users with four options:
 1)adding tasks to a predefined array, 2)updating existing tasks, 3)viewing the entire array, 4)and deleting specific tasks.
 The application provides an interactive experience for users to manage their tasks seamlessly.

ðŸš€This project showcases the power and flexibility of TypeScript, combining static typing with the ease of JavaScript.
ðŸš€The array manipulation operations enable users to customize their to-do list efficiently, from adding new tasks to removing completed ones.

ðŸ’¡ One of the key takeaways from this project is the simplicity and readability that TypeScript brings to the table.
 The well-defined types and structured code make the application robust and easy to maintain.
ðŸ’¡Learning some important topics.
 The key topics covered include:

- Async/await: async/await functionality adds a layer of ease in executing promises within typescript.
 The async keyword will help wrap up any function even if it doesnâ€™t start with the promise keyword.
 Once it is fulfilled, the await will return the value of the function. 

- pop: pop() method removes the last element from an array and returns that element.

- push: push() method appends the given elements in the last of the array and returns the length of the new array.

- Inquirer: Inquirer is an NPM package that provides an easy way to capture user input in your Node. js command line interface applications.
 It provides several methods for asking questions and returning answers from the user.
